    <p> Howdy ya'll! Let me introduce myself. I'm from San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. What is interesting about me is that I'm an introverted person but sometimes outgoing when I've known someone for a long time.</p>
    <p>This is my first semester at BYU-I, and maybe I'm going to pause for a while because I'll be serving a mission!</p>
    <p>There are five people in my family, which is awesome because I have two siblings with whom I can play and discuss various topics when I'm feeling bored or tired.</p>
